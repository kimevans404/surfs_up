# Surfs up!

## Overview of the analysis
### Background and purpose of this project
A fictional client, W. Avy, has requested a weather analysis before opening a surf and ice cream shop. After analysing precipitation data, a new request was made to analyze temperature trends for June and December in Oahu to ensure sufficient traffic will allow the shop to be open year-round.

## Results

- Over the course of the collected data we can see that June's high and low temperatures are slightly higher than in December which is expected. In june we see the temperature is mainly 73-77 degrees, where December sits at 69-74.
- December's daily temperatures tend to have higher hot-cold fluctuation much more than in June.
- Then lowest temperature recorded in June was 64 depgrees, where December's lowest was 56 which would be too cold to keep the ice cream shop busy, but it only dropped that low one year.

## Summary
### Additional queries for June and December
With the analysis results we can see that even though temperatures vary throughout the year, cooler days are limited, so Oahu would be a great place to open the surf and ice cream shop. In this part of the analysis we are focusing on temperature, but would greatly benifit from comparing temperatures to precipitation. It would be expected that the surf and ice cream shop would be less busy on rainy days and cooler days, but those dates may overlap. Another thing to look into would be an analysis of daily averages. The date that had the lowest temperature recorded stil had a high temperature over 70.
